# Ghostploy_Insights
This project analyzes the effectiveness of job search engines in recommending job opportunities. Using data from my job applications, the goal is to identify how well the recommendations align with the skills, titles, and locations that I apply to.

### Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** Job search engines are not providing high-quality job recommendations based on my previous applications, and I will analyze the accuracy of their recommendations.

### Goals

- Manually input data about job applications into LibreOffice Calc.
- Export the data to CSV format.
- Analyze how well the job recommendations match my job preferences.
- Visualize trends and insights to determine the effectiveness of job search engines.
